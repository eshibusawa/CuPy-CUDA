    "# Basic Texture Sampling\n",
    "This notebook focuses on texture memory, a powerful tool in GPU programming.\n",
    "Texture memory has its own unique caching mechanism, specifically optimized for accessing 2D data like images and grid data.\n",
    "When combined with 2D thread blocks, which are frequently used in image processing, texture memory enables efficient data access and sampling.\n",
    "This allows for intuitive data access using texture coordinates, along with built-in interpolation features and flexible addressing modes.\n",
    "These characteristics make texture memory particularly effective for stencil pattern computations, where each pixel's value depends on its surrounding neighbors."
